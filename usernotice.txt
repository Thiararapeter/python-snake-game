# Python Snake Game

## Description:

The Python Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake on the screen. The objective is to eat food items that appear on the screen, which causes the snake to grow longer. The game continues until the snake either runs into the screen border or collides with itself. The player earns points for each food item consumed.

## Features:

1. **Snake Movement:** The player can control the snake's movement using arrow keys.
2. **Food Items:** Randomly generated food items appear on the screen for the snake to eat.
3. **Obstacles:** As the player scores points, obstacles are introduced, adding complexity to the game.
4. **Lives:** The player starts with three lives. Colliding with obstacles reduces lives, and running out of lives ends the game.
5. **Time Limit:** The game has a time limit. If the player fails to reach a certain score within the time limit, the game ends.
6. **Score Tracking:** The player's score is displayed on the screen, along with the highest score achieved.
7. **Pause Feature:** The player can pause the game by pressing the 'P' key.
8. **Game Over Screen:** When the game ends, a "Game Over" screen is displayed, allowing the player to restart.

## Controls:

- **Arrow keys:** Control the snake's direction.
- **Enter key:** Restart the game after Game Over.
- **P key:** Pause and resume the game.
